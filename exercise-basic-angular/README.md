# Welcome to exercise - Basic Angular

In this exercise were going to explore creation of components & services

- Create component
- Render data
- Use various built in directives
- Implement inter component communication 
- Create and use service

## TODO 0: Start application
Make sure your application is installed `npm ci` and is running by executing `npm start`

## TODO 1: Create CustomerItemComponent and related logic
1. Use `ng g c features/customers/customer-item` to generate new component, it will automatically be added to the `declarations: [ ]` of `CustomersModule`...
2. In the `customers.component.html` render `<my-org-customer-item></my-org-customer-item>` for every value in `customers` array (hint use `*ngFor` directive)
3. In the `customer-item.component.ts` define `@Input()` which accepts the customer object from the parent into `customer` property and also uses `Customer` interface
4. In the `customers.component.html` pass the `customer` object (from `*ngFor` iteration) down to the `<my-org-customer-item></my-org-customer-item>` using `[customer]` property binding
5. In the `customer-item.component.ts` try to log out value `@Input() customer` property in the constructor and in the `ngOnInit()` lifecycle hook (don't forget) to implement the interface! And check out console in your browser Dev Tools... (hint `console.log('constructor', this.customer);`) 
6. In the `customer-item.component.html` add `<mat-card></mat-card>` as a top level element and render customer name and surname into `<p>` tag inside the card with the help of interpolation `{{ }}` 
7. In the `customer-item.component.scss` add css rule for `mat-card` setting its `display: flex;`, `align-items: center;` and `justify-content: space-between;` and another rule for `p` setting its `margin` to `0` and  `width` to `200px;`
8. In the `customer-item.component.html` add `<mat-icon>person</mat-icon>` before the `<p>` tag
9. In the `customer-item.component.html` add `[ngClass]` directive on the `<mat-card>` element which should set `vip` class based on the value of `customer.isVip` property
10. In the `customer-item.component.scss` add nested css rule inside of `mat-card` using which will define rule for `.vip` class (nested rules that belong to element are prefixed with `&`, so `&.vip`) and add rule that sets `background-color` to `#fff4ba`
11. In the `customer-item.component.html` add `<mat-icon>star</mat-icon>` but display it conditionally only for the VIP customers (hint:  use `*ngIf` directive)
12. Also, we do not want to display two icons at the same time so hide the original `person` icon in case the customer is VIP
13. In the `customer-item.component.html` add `<button>` with `mat-stroked-button` directive and `Say hello` text content, after that add `(click)` event binding which will call `sayHello()` method and pass in the `customer` object as an argument
14. In the `customer-item.component.ts` implement public `sayHello()` method which accepts `customer` of type `Customer` as an argument and logs out customer full name when called (hint: try use javascript template string (back ticks and `${variable}`), to concatenate name and the surname), then open the browser dev tools look into console and click on the button
15. In the `customer-item.component.html` add `<button>` with `mat-raised-button` directive and `Purchase item` text content, after that add `(click)` event binding which will call `purchaseItem()` method pass in the `customer` object as an argument
16. In the `customer-item.component.ts` implement public `purchaseItem()` method which accepts `customer` of type `Customer` as an argument 
17. Continue by creating `@Output() purchase` property which will be initialized with `new Subject<{ customerId: number, order: number }>()`, we're using inline type, please extract it into `Purchase` Typescript interface and export it ( in the same file )
18. Inside of previously created `purchaseItem()` method we can now call `this.purchase.next()` and pass in and object with `customerId` property with value of the `customer` ID and `order` property with some random number (we can get random number by using `Math.ceil(Math.random() * 1000)`)
19. In the `customers.component.html` add new event binding that listens to the new custom `(purchase)` event of the `<my-org-customer-item>` and calls `handlePurchase()` method with `$event` as an argument
20. In the `customers.component.ts` implement the `handlePurchase()` method which accepts argument of type `Purchase`, use `customerId` to get hold of appropriate `customer` and add received `order` value to its `orders` array (this has to be done by re-creating `customers` array using `.map()` in which we re-create every customer object using object spread `{ ...customer }` and overriding the `orders` array for customer matched by the ID)
21. Create new order service using `ng g s features/customers/services/order` and inject it into `CustomerItemComponent` using constructor injection (optional, remove the `providedIn: 'root'` and provide service using `providers: []` array of the lazy loaded `CustomersModule` to prevent its usage in other parts of the application...)
22. Inside of the service create new `calculateTotal` method which accepts customer `orders` array (of numbers) and calculates and returns total order value (hint: use array reduce)
23. In the `customer-item.component.ts` define new public `totalOrderValue` component property with value of `0` and display it in the template using interpolation `{{ }}` (can be in the new `<p>` tag)
24. In the `customer-item.component.ts` import and implement `OnChanges` lifecycle hook and inside of that hook call previously injected `OrderService` to calculate total order value (based on customer `orders` property) and store it in the `totalOrderValue` property
25. Try placing some orders by clicking the button
26. In the `customer-item.component.ts` try adding another public `calculateTotal()` component method which will `console.log('method called');` call the `OrderService` service and return total value, try calling this function in the template ( in another `<p>` tag ) using interpolation `{{calculateTotal()}}` open console and try to click multiple buttons, how often is the function executed, why is it a problem?

# Epic! We have implemented Angular components using various template concepts like interpolation and directives, our components communicate using inputs (@Input) and events (@Output) and use injected service inside of life-cycle hook to calculate derived state in a way that doesn't harm the performance!

## How to start

- try searching for numbered `TODO` readme items and `// TODO` code comments in the `projects` folder or use TODO functionality of your editor 

## How to use exercises

- every exercise folder should be installed using `npm ci`
- every exercise can be started using `npm start` to run the app
- every exercise can start tests in watch mode using `npm run watch`
- every exercise has it's own `README.md` file with additional description of the given exercise
- every exercise project contains ordered `TODO ` in the readme and `// TODO` comments inside of the source code (eg `// TODO 2: description`) which should be followed to complete the given exercise
- you can always search for `// TODO`, or `<!-- TODO` or check `README.md` for the next TODO item
